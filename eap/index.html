		  <h3>Life of Poe:</h3>
		  <p>Born on January 18th, 1809, Poe had two other siblings and all were separated upon the death of their parents. Poe was taken in by a wealthy tobacco merchant, John Allan, and his wife Frances in Richmond, Virginia. Despite the push to be a business man, Poe dreamed of becoming a writer. </p>
		  <p>In 1826, Poe went off to the University of Virginia. He did well in his courses but, since he was sent by Mr. Allan with only a third of the money he needed, he racked up considerable debt. Poe took up gambling to pay his debt and burned his furniture
			in an effort to stay warm.</p>
		  <p>Poe, angry at John Allan for not providing him with sufficient money, went off to become a writer and for adventure. He published his first book, Tamerlane, at 18 years of age then enlisted in the army. Two years later, Poe got an appointment at West
			Point where he lasted 8 months before being thrown out. He soon published another novel, however.</p>
		  <p>Poe returned to Baltimore where he stayed with an aunt. He wrote many short stories, won a contest with one, and, through connections, soon became an editor with the Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond. He helped the magazine take off and became
			well known for his fearless, insulting reviews. His aunt and her daughter, Virginia, joined him in Richmond. Poe soon married Virginia who was not yet 14.</p>
		  <p>Poe spent the next several years moving from one city to another looking always for better opportunities. He continued to struggle making a living despite publishing short stories and novels. His wife contracted tuberculosis and deteriorated quickly.</p>
		  <p>In 1845, his publication of 'The Raven', made him well known. He tried to run his own magazine but it failed. Poe left New York City in 1846 and moved to a cottage in the country where, in the winter of 1847, his wife passed away.</p>
		  <p>Poe was unable to write for months and critics proposed that he soon would be dead. In fact, he only lived for another 2 years after the death of Virginia. During those 2 years, he again traveled between cities, lecturing and attempting to start a
			magazine project. Poe met a woman, Nancy Richmond, and his love for her led to some of his most famous poetry. Since Nancy was married, Poe attempted to marry Sarah Helen Whitman, but they had only a month long engagement. He began to date his former
			fiancee from back in college. Poe left Richmond for Philadelphia. On the way he stopped in Baltimore and then disappeared for 5 days.</p>
		  <p>Poe was found in a public house bar room and was sent to Washington College Hospital. He spent his final days away from family and his home. His fiancee and mother-in-law found out about him from the paper. Edgar Allan Poe died October 7, 1849 at
			40 years of age. The cause of his death is still unknown.</p>
		  <p>Interestingly, a rival writer wrote a hateful obituary portraying Poe as a lonely, drunken womanizer in an attempt to decrease the value of Poe's work. Instead, the attack led to a skyrocket of sales, more than during Poe's life.</p>

		  <h4>Quotes:</h4>
		  <p>"They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night."</p>
		  <p>"Sleep, those little slices of death â€” how I loathe them."</p>
		  <p>"I was never really insane except upon occasions where my heart was touched."</p>
		  <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary..."</p>
		  <p>"The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other begins?"</p>

		  <h4>Interesting Facts</h4>
		  <p>Edgar was obsessed with cats and would often write with a cat on his shoulder.</p>
		  <p>He is credited for establishing the present-day short story.</p>
		  <p>In 1844, Poe published in the Sun Newspaper <i>The Balloon</i>, a story where he described a balloon, that was lighter than air, that made it across the Atlantic Ocean in three days. His story was so believable that the newspaper retracted the story
			  two days later. The newspaper made a ton of money off of <i>The Balloon</i> but they did not give Poe a cent.</p>
